    1. What columns violate 1NF?
    - Columns food_code and food_description violate 1NF as they contain multiple values.
    - Column dinner_date violates 1NF as in each column, the values stored must be the same type.

    2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
    I recognize that these entities can be extracted:
        Members (member_id, member_name, member_address)
        Dinners (dinner_id, dinner_date, venue_code)
        Venues (venue_code, venue_description)
        Foods (food_code, food_description)

    3.Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
    
        Members Table         (member_id (PK), member_name, member_address)
        Dinners Table         (dinner_id (PK), dinner_date, venue_code(FK))
        Venues Table          (venue_code (PK), venue_description)
        Foods Table           (food_code (PK), food_description)
        Members_diners Table  (id (PK), member_id (FK), dinner_id (FK))
        Dinners_food Table    (id (PK), dinner_id (FK), food_code (FK))
